## Core MMT Principles

### Key Concepts
1. **Monetary Sovereignty**: Governments with sovereign currencies create money when spending - they don't need to tax or borrow first
2. **Real Constraints**: The real constraint on government spending is **inflation**, not money itself
3. **Resource-Based Economics**: It's about available real resources (labor, materials, capacity, technology, ecological capacity)
4. **Deficit Neutrality**: MMT doesn't advocate for big deficits - it's a framework for understanding how modern monetary systems actually work

### Common Misconceptions
- ❌ "MMT says governments can print money without limit"
  - ✅ MMT is explicit that inflation is the real constraint when real resources are exhausted
- ❌ "MMT advocates for big deficits"
  - ✅ MMT is agnostic about deficits - it's an analytical framework, not a policy prescription
